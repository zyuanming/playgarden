/**
 * Pure collision resolution for the runner.
 *
 * This module has NO Three.js dependency. It is the seam between the player
 * state machine (src/player) + the world track (src/track) and the game's
 * crash / coin-tally glue (src/main.ts). Given the player STATE (lane occupancy
 * + vertical mode) and the active placements, it returns whether the player is
 * hit this frame and which coins were collected, as a pure value.
 *
 * Collision model (decisions documented here, per the issue brief)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * Player z-band. The avatar sits at a FIXED world Z near the front of the deck
 * (render/scene.ts: AVATAR_Z = -2). The world scrolls toward the camera, so a
 * placement at track distance `p.z` is drawn at world Z `-(p.z - distance)`
 * (render/scene.ts). A placement is level with the avatar when that world Z
 * equals AVATAR_Z, i.e. -(p.z - distance) = -2  =>  p.z = distance + 2. We call
 * `distance + PLAYER_Z_OFFSET` the player's effective world z (`playerZ`), and a
 * placement counts as "at" the player when abs(p.z - playerZ) <= HALF_DEPTH.
 * HALF_DEPTH is half a row of tolerance so a placement registers across the few
 * frames it straddles the avatar at the world scroll speed.
 *
 * Lane occupancy during a lateral tween. While the player is mid-switch
 * (laneT < 1) we treat them as occupying BOTH `fromLane` and `lane`. This is the
 * CONSERVATIVE choice: you cannot phase through a side obstacle by being caught
 * mid-tween. Once the tween settles (laneT >= 1) only `lane` is occupied
 * (fromLane equals lane by then anyway).
 *
 * Clearing rules (PlacementType from src/track):
 *  - mode === "jumping"  clears `obstacle-low`  (you jump over it).
 *  - mode === "sliding"  clears `obstacle-high` (you slide under it).
 *  - `full-block` is NEVER cleared by jump/slide; it is only avoided by being in
 *    a different lane.
 *  - a `coin` in an occupied lane within the z-band is COLLECTED and never a hit.
 *
 * A hit = an uncleared obstacle or full-block in an occupied lane within the
 * z-band.
