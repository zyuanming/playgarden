/**
 * Pure player movement state machine for the runner.
 *
 * This module has NO Three.js dependency. It is the primary seam between game
 * logic and rendering: `step(state, intent, dt)` advances an immutable player
 * state, and `pose(state)` projects it to a small render-facing pose
 * (continuous x / y / squash) that the renderer maps onto an avatar mesh. The
 * rigged-avatar swap (#12) consumes `pose`, so it can land without touching this
 * file.
 *
 * Transition model
 * ----------------
 * - Lanes are DISCRETE ("left" | "center" | "right"), reusing the track's Lane
 *   type and LANE_X positions. A move intent retargets one lane at a time
 *   (never two at once) and the lateral position TWEENS from the old lane to the
 *   new one over LANE_TWEEN_SECONDS via `laneT` (0..1). `lane` is the *target*
 *   lane; `fromLane` is where the tween started. A new move intent is accepted
 *   only when the current tween has completed (laneT >= 1), so moves do not
 *   stack. Edge lanes clamp: a left intent in the left lane is a no-op.
 * - Vertical is a small state machine: "grounded" | "jumping" | "sliding".
 *   A jump follows a fixed parabolic arc of height JUMP_HEIGHT over
 *   JUMP_SECONDS, then auto-returns to grounded. A slide lowers/squashes the
 *   avatar for SLIDE_SECONDS, then auto-returns. You cannot jump while sliding
 *   or slide while jumping; such an intent is buffered (see below).
 * - Input buffering: a jump/slide intent that cannot act on the current frame
 *   (because the player is airborne or sliding) is remembered for up to
 *   BUFFER_SECONDS and replayed automatically the moment the player is grounded
 *   again. Lateral move intents are NOT buffered (they are cheap to re-press and
 *   buffering them fights the player).
 * - Coyote time: a jump pressed during the FINAL COYOTE_SECONDS of a slide is
 *   forgiven - it cancels the remaining slide and jumps immediately, instead of
 *   waiting for the slide to fully auto-return. (Earlier in the slide a jump is
 *   buffered instead; see above.) This is the "a jump shortly after leaving the
 *   grounded state still jumps" forgiveness window: the slide is the grounded
 *   action, and the window straddles its end so a slightly-early press lands.
 *
 * All transitions happen on the SAME frame the intent arrives (movement reacts
 * immediately), satisfying the spec's "reacts on the same frame as input".
