/**
 * Pure scoring for the runner.
 *
 * This module has NO Three.js and NO DOM dependency. It is the seam between the
 * world distance + coin tally (held as glue in src/main.ts) and what the HUD /
 * game-over overlay display. Two pieces:
 *
 *  1. `scoreFor(distance, coins)` - pure accumulation: floored distance plus a
 *     flat per-coin bonus.
 *  2. `createHighScore(storage, key)` - a persisted best backed by INJECTED
 *     storage (real `localStorage` in the app, a fake in tests).
 *
 * Decisions (per the issue brief)
 * -------------------------------
 * COIN_VALUE: each coin is worth 10 points. Coins are sparse relative to the
 * per-unit distance score, so 10 makes a single coin a meaningful but not
 * distance-dominating reward.
 *
 * HIGH_SCORE_KEY: the default localStorage key is namespaced
 * `playgarden.cloudrunner.v1.best` to avoid clashing with anything else on the origin.
 *
 * Graceful fallback: storage can be absent (private mode) or throw on access.
 * The store NEVER propagates a storage error. A failed read is treated as 0; a
 * failed write is a no-op. The best is also held in memory, so within a session
 * submit() still tracks the running max even when persistence is unavailable.
