/**
 * Difficulty curve.
 *
 * Pure mapping from how far the run has progressed to the three knobs that make
 * the game ramp: world scroll `speed`, obstacle `density`, and pattern
 * `complexity`. No Three.js, no state, no randomness - just a function of one
 * number, so it is trivially testable for monotonicity and bounds.
 *
 * Design decisions (per spec #7):
 *  - INPUT is run distance (world units), not wall-clock time. Distance is the
 *    deterministic quantity the rest of the game already keys on (track z, score),
 *    so a given point in the track always has the same difficulty regardless of
 *    frame rate or pauses. This keeps generation reproducible.
 *  - Each output is BOUNDED and monotonic non-decreasing in distance (never
 *    easier as the run grows), and EASES toward a cap rather than growing without
 *    limit, via a saturating exponential `1 - exp(-distance / scale)`. That
 *    factor `r` runs 0 -> 1 as distance grows, fast at first then flattening.
 *  - speed:      BASE_SPEED .. MAX_SPEED   (units/sec). Starts exactly at the
 *                game's base SPEED so frame 0 is unchanged.
 *  - density:    0 .. 1   (feeds the generator's difficulty arg; higher = more
 *                obstacle-heavy chunks).
 *  - complexity: 0 .. 1   (also feeds the generator; higher = more
 *                lane-shifting / multi-block patterns).
 *
 *  density and complexity are combined into the single [0,1] difficulty argument
 *  the track generator accepts (see `generatorDifficulty`).
