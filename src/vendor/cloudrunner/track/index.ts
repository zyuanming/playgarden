/**
 * Procedural track generation.
 *
 * The track is a deterministic, seedable sequence of placements laid out along
 * the world's negative-Z axis. A placement is a single obstacle or coin pinned
 * to one of three lanes at a fixed Z distance. The world scrolls toward the
 * camera (see render/scene.ts), so larger Z values arrive later.
 *
 * Generation stitches small hand-authored chunks (the catalog) and runs a pure
 * fairness validator so that every produced track is clearable at the world
 * speed. See `isClearable` for the fairness model.
