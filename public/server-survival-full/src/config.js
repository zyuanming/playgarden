  // The numbers survived the economics pass in #195 (single Compute vs ASG
  // Compute vs Serverless over four traffic profiles): warmup and sustain are
  // long enough that a burst still hurts (the cold-start lesson), and at
  // targetUtil 0.7 the fleet stays right-sized — ~2 instances at 10 RPS —
  // instead of over-provisioning. Serverless still wins idle and spiky
  // traffic, a fixed Compute wins steady mid-range traffic, and the ASG is
  // the only option that survives past Serverless's capacity ceiling.
  // Load signal (#74). `totalLoad` is an instantaneous ratio whose numerator is
  // an integer job count, so on a tier-1 Compute (capacity 4) it can only take
  // the values 0.75, 1.00, 1.25 — and a sweep of the reference board measured
  // its mean dwell inside the interesting band at 0.10-0.25 s at EVERY load.
  // That is a strobe, not a state: no threshold placed on the instantaneous
  // signal can describe something a player is able to see and act on.
  //
  // `smoothedLoad` is the same quantity through a trailing exponential mean, so
  // it is continuous (resolution ~0.001 instead of 1/capacity) and persists
  // long enough to be read. tau is in GAME seconds — the update is driven by
  // the game-scaled dt, so fast-forward advances it by game time, not frames.
  // Every threshold below is expressed in smoothedLoad, where 0.5 is 100% of
  // rated capacity (the denominator carries a x2 — see Service.totalLoad). The
  // shipped numbers were all calibrated against the WRONG half of that scale:
  // the ring turned orange at 0.5 — exactly when a node begins dropping
  // requests — and red only at 0.8, which is 160% of capacity, deep inside
  // collapse. The $75 Monitoring node alerted at 0.85, i.e. 170%, long past
  // the point where the information could still be used.
  //
  // Recalibrated so the colours mean what a player would assume: red is "at
  // capacity, dropping next", and the alert arrives BEFORE the first drop.
