// Retry with backoff (#196, Wave 1 of #193). A request that hits a transient
// service-level failure gets ONE more chance (CONFIG.resilience.maxRetries)
// via a healthy peer before it is counted as failed — the transient-fault
// lesson, and, if the knobs are ever loosened, the retry-storm lesson.
//
// WHY THIS IS THE ONLY RETRY SITE: the single unambiguous "transient" failure
// in the sim is the load/health failure roll in Service.update(). Every other
// failRequest() call is a topology verdict ("no route to the destination", "a
// Replica cannot serve a WRITE", "the queue is full") — retrying those would
// just burn the same dead end again. Keeping the hook to one site is also what
// keeps THE CARDINAL INVARIANT provable: a retried request is still owned by
// exactly one terminator.
//
// FLIGHT MODEL, NOT setTimeout: the backoff is a countdown on the request,
// ticked by Request.update(dt) with the same game-scaled dt as everything else
// (pause freezes it, fast-forward speeds it up, and a reset that drops
// STATE.requests takes the pending retry with it — a raw setTimeout would
// outlive the reset, which is the #183 class of bug). When the countdown ends
// the request either flies to a still-valid peer or is failed on the spot, so
// it always terminates.
//
// COUNTING: a retried request is neither completed nor failed at retry time —
// it is still in flight. It is counted exactly once, when it finally reaches
// finishRequest / failRequest / removeRequest. The FAILED SERVICE is still
// charged the error (metrics + breaker) at the moment of the failure, because
// the error genuinely happened there.
