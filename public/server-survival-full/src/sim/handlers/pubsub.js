// Pub/Sub Topic job handler (#197, Sandbox archetypes batch 1). The ONLY
// handler that MULTIPLIES requests: an inbound request fans out to one delivery
// per connected subscriber. The original is delivered to the first subscriber;
// one CLONE is minted for every additional subscriber. Fan-out is capped at the
// subscriber count by construction, so it can never explode.
//
// Termination invariant (#191/#192) — the whole reason this handler is written
// carefully: every copy is a real Request that must terminate exactly once.
//   - the ORIGINAL is consumed here by being flown to subscriber #0 (it
//     terminates on that subscriber's normal path);
//   - each CLONE is pushed into STATE.requests and flown to its own subscriber,
//     terminating there;
//   - with NO routable subscriber the original is failed (or parked in a wired
//     DLQ) — never left hanging.
// Cloning happens BEFORE the original is re-flown so the clone copies a clean
// origin, and clones are plain Requests of the same traffic type, indistinct
// from organically spawned traffic thereafter.
