# Server Survival

![Gameplay Demo](assets/gameplay.gif)

**Server Survival** is an interactive 3D simulation game where you play as a **Cloud Architect**. Your mission is to build and scale a resilient cloud infrastructure to handle increasing traffic loads while fighting off DDoS attacks, managing your budget, and keeping your services healthy.

> 🏭 **New: [Datacenter Survival](https://github.com/pshenok/datacenter-survival)** — the sister game. This one teaches the *logical* layer of the cloud; that one teaches the *physical* layer it runs on: power chains, heat, cooling, PUE. [Play it here](https://pshenok.github.io/datacenter-survival/).

## Game Modes

- **Survival** — the core experience: survive as long as possible against escalating traffic, DDoS spikes, random events, and service degradation.
- **Campaign** — 25 hand-crafted levels across 5 chapters (Basics → Optimization → Defense & Mastery → Production Readiness → The AI Wave). Each level teaches one architecture concept with pre-built diagrams, objectives, and a debrief.
- **Sandbox** — a free-play lab: any budget, any traffic mix, no game over. Experiment with all 26 services.

## What It Teaches

Every mechanic is a real cloud concept in miniature:

- **Observability** — place a Monitoring node to unlock a live metrics dashboard (RPS, error rate, latency sparklines) and alerts. Level 15 makes you fly blind without it first.
- **Auto-scaling & cold start** — Compute fleets scale out at 70% utilization and back in at 30%, but new instances need warmup time (Containers even more so).
- **Queue-depth scaling** — a queue-fed fleet scales on queue pressure, not just CPU, so backlogs trigger scale-out.
- **Circuit breaking & retries** — overloaded downstreams trip a breaker (50% error rate over a rolling window), traffic is retried with backoff, and SPOFs get flagged.
- **Multi-region failover** — GeoDNS splits traffic across regional stacks; region-outage events show why one region is never enough.
- **Inference serving & batching** — the GPU Cluster batches INFERENCE requests (up to 8/12/16 by tier) into one job that amortizes a fixed per-batch cost, so profit is all utilization: a full batch prints money, a half-fed GPU bleeds its $60/min upkeep.
- **Model cold starts & quality** — a GPU loads its model for 12/20/30s before serving anything, and every tier upgrade reloads it; bigger models also answer better (10% → 4% → 1% bad-answer risk, −0.5 reputation per bad answer).
- **Inference SLOs** — the Inference Gateway buffers for warming or busy GPUs but expires anything older than its 6s deadline: a stale generation is failed honestly, never served.
- **Power as the constraint** — the grid carries 8 kW, every GPU draws 6, and a Substation adds 6: the fleet's ceiling is bought in watts before it is bought in dollars.
- **OLTP vs OLAP** — the Data Warehouse takes analytics writes cheaply but refuses realtime reads; the Relational DB does the opposite trade.
- **Failure-reason badges** — every dropped request pops a badge on the node that dropped it, saying *why* (no route, capacity, read-only replica, search-only index...).

## How to Play

### Objective

Survive as long as possible! Manage your **Budget ($)**, **Reputation (%)**, and **Service Health**.

- **Earn Money** by successfully processing legitimate traffic requests.
- **Lose Reputation** if requests fail or if malicious traffic slips through.
- **Maintain Health** - Services degrade under load and need repairs.
- **Game Over** if Reputation hits 0% or you go bankrupt ($-1000).

### Traffic Types

| Traffic       | Color  | Destination                       | Reward | Description                            |
| :------------ | :----- | :-------------------------------- | :----- | :------------------------------------- |
| **STATIC**    | Green  | CDN / Storage                     | $0.50  | Static file requests (images, CSS, JS) |
| **READ**      | Blue   | Replica / NoSQL / SQL DB          | $0.80  | Database read operations               |
| **WRITE**     | Orange | NoSQL / SQL DB / Warehouse        | $1.20  | Database write operations              |
| **UPLOAD**    | Yellow | Storage / Warehouse               | $1.50  | File uploads                           |
| **SEARCH**    | Cyan   | Search Engine / SQL DB            | $1.20  | Search queries (Search Engine preferred, SQL DB fallback) |
| **MALICIOUS** | Red    | Blocked by Firewall / Identity Provider | $0 | DDoS attacks — block them or bleed reputation! |
| **INFERENCE** | Fuchsia | GPU Cluster (via Inference Gateway) | $0.50 | AI generation requests — batched on GPUs, with per-request generation length |

### Infrastructure & Services

Build your architecture using the toolbar. All 26 services are organized into five category tabs — the same taxonomy as the table below. Each service has a cost, capacity, and per-minute upkeep:

| Category   | Service                 | Cost | Capacity        | Upkeep              | Role                                                                 |
| :--------- | :---------------------- | :--- | :-------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Front door | **GeoDNS**              | $50  | 60              | $4/min              | Front door for the whole site: splits traffic across independent regional stacks. |
| Front door | **CDN**                 | $60  | 50              | $5/min              | Caches STATIC content at the edge (95% hit rate).                     |
| Front door | **Firewall**            | $40  | 30              | $4/min              | The first line of defense. Blocks malicious traffic.                  |
| Front door | **Identity Provider**   | $55  | 20              | $6/min              | Adds latency but catches session-based attacks a WAF misses.          |
| Front door | **API Gateway**         | $70  | 60              | $8/min              | Rate limits traffic. Throttled requests lose less reputation than failures. **Upgradeable T1–T3.** |
| Front door | **Load Balancer**       | $50  | 20              | $6/min              | Distributes traffic to multiple Compute instances.                    |
| Compute    | **Compute**             | $60  | 4               | $12/min             | Processes requests. Auto-scales into a fleet (with cold start). **Upgradeable T1–T3.** |
| Compute    | **Serverless Function** | $45  | 30              | $2/min + $0.03/req  | Auto-scales with traffic. Very low upkeep but pays per completed request — cheap when idle, expensive at high RPS. |
| Compute    | **Container Cluster**   | $120 | 12              | $16/min             | Dense fixed capacity at a flat fee. Slow node-pool warmup on scale-out. |
| Compute    | **GPU Cluster**         | $300 | 8               | $60/min             | Batches INFERENCE into one amortized job. Model cold-starts on placement and on every tier upgrade; draws 6 kW. **Upgradeable T1–T3.** |
| Compute    | **Inference Gateway**   | $70  | 10 (queue 20)   | $5/min              | Holds INFERENCE for warming/full GPUs, dispatches to the least-loaded one — and expires anything older than its 6s deadline. |
| Data       | **Relational DB**       | $150 | 8               | $24/min             | Destination for READ/WRITE/SEARCH traffic. **Upgradeable T1–T3.**     |
| Data       | **NoSQL DB**            | $80  | 15              | $14/min             | Fast for READ/WRITE, but cannot handle SEARCH queries. **Upgradeable T1–T3.** |
| Data       | **Memory Cache**        | $60  | 30              | $8/min              | Caches responses to reduce DB load. **Upgradeable T1–T3.**            |
| Data       | **File Storage**        | $25  | 25              | $5/min              | Destination for STATIC/UPLOAD traffic.                                |
| Data       | **Search Engine**       | $120 | 12              | $16/min             | Specialized for SEARCH queries. 3× faster than SQL DB. **Upgradeable T1–T3.** |
| Data       | **Read Replica**        | $100 | 12              | $12/min             | Offloads READ traffic from the master DB. Requires connection to a DB. **Upgradeable T1–T3.** |
| Data       | **Data Warehouse**      | $90  | 40              | $8/min              | Stores analytics WRITEs cheaply and slowly. Cannot serve realtime READ. |
| Async      | **Message Queue**       | $45  | 50 (queue 200)  | $3/min              | Buffers requests during spikes. Prevents drops.                       |
| Async      | **Pub/Sub Topic**       | $65  | 30              | $6/min              | Fan-out: one event becomes one delivery per subscriber.               |
| Async      | **Stream**              | $90  | 40 (queue 200)  | $10/min             | High throughput, strictly ordered per partition. A stalled partition backs up its tail. |
| Async      | **Dead-Letter Queue**   | $55  | 25              | $4/min              | Parks requests that finally failed, draining them back for a cost.    |
| Async      | **Scheduler**           | $50  | 1               | $5/min              | Injects its own scheduled batch-job bursts on a timer.                |
| Async      | **Notification**        | $40  | 20              | $4/min              | Terminal "send": success earns reputation, failures are silent.       |
| Ops        | **Monitoring**          | $75  | 1               | $8/min              | Unlocks the live metrics dashboard and alerts.                        |
| Ops        | **Substation**          | $150 | 1               | $8/min              | +6 kW of grid capacity on the 8 kW base. GPUs draw 6 kW each and cannot be placed past the cap. |

### Upkeep & Cost Scaling

- **Base Upkeep:** Each service has per-minute upkeep costs
- **Upkeep Scaling:** Costs increase 1x to 2x over 10 minutes
- **Repair Costs:** 15% of service cost to manually repair
- **Auto-Repair:** +10% upkeep overhead when enabled

### Survival Mode

The core experience - survive as long as possible against escalating traffic with constant intervention required:

- **RPS Acceleration** - Traffic multiplies at time milestones (×1.3 at 1min → ×4.0 at 10min)
- **Random Events** - Cost spikes, capacity drops, traffic bursts, service outages every 15-45 seconds
- **Traffic Shifts** - Traffic patterns change every 40 seconds
- **DDoS Spikes** - 50% malicious traffic waves every 45 seconds
- **Service Degradation** - Services lose health under load, require repairs
- **Health bars, event indicator, finances panel, auto-repair toggle, game-over analysis**

### Campaign Mode

25 levels across 5 chapters, each one a scenario built around a single lesson:

1. **Basics** (levels 1-3) — your first server, storage, and edge caching with a CDN.
2. **Optimization** (levels 4-10) — caching, queues, read scaling, search, NoSQL, rate limiting, serverless vs compute.
3. **Defense & Mastery** (levels 11-14) — defense in depth, high availability, cost crunches, and Black Friday.
4. **Production Readiness** (levels 15-20) — observability, auto-scaling, node failures, dead-letter queues, fan-out, and two-region failover.
5. **The AI Wave** (levels 21-25) — GPU inference: model cold starts, batch-fill economics, SLO deadlines, the power wall, and a capstone that has to end in the black.

Levels come with pre-built starting architectures, primary and bonus objectives, speedrun stars, and a debrief tip. Later chapters throw forced outages — including a whole region going dark — at your build.

### Sandbox Mode

A fully customizable testing environment for experimenting with any architecture:

| Control           | Description                                                       |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Budget**        | Set any starting budget (slider 0-10K, or type any amount)        |
| **RPS**           | Control traffic rate (0 = stopped, or type 100+ for stress tests) |
| **Traffic Mix**   | Adjust all 7 traffic type percentages independently               |
| **Burst**         | Spawn instant bursts of specific traffic types                    |
| **Upkeep Toggle** | Enable/disable service costs                                      |
| **Clear All**     | Reset all services and restore budget                             |

**No game over in Sandbox** - experiment freely!

### Share Your Architecture

Built something you're proud of? The share panel exports your architecture two ways:

- **PNG export** — a clean image of your diagram to post anywhere.
- **Shareable URL** — your whole build encoded in a `?arch=` link; anyone who opens it gets your architecture loaded and ready to run.

### Controls

- **Left Click:** Select tools, place services, and connect nodes.
- **Right Click + Drag:** Pan the camera.
- **Scroll:** Zoom in and out.
- **WASD / Arrows:** Move camera (pan) when zoomed in.
- **ESC:** Open main menu and pause game. Press again or click Resume to close menu (stays paused).
- **Camera Reset:** Press `R` to reset the camera position.
- **Birds-Eye View:** Press `T` to switch between isometric and top-down view.
- **Hide HUD:** Press `H` to toggle UI panels.
- **Category Tabs:** The toolbar groups services into five tabs — Front Door, Compute, Data, Async, Ops. Keys `1-5` switch between them.
- **Build Tools:** `V` Select, `C` Link, `X` Demolish, `U` Unlink. Each key is shown in the corner of its button.
- **Connect Tool:** Click two nodes to create a connection (flow direction matters!).
  - _Valid Flows:_ Internet -> (GeoDNS/Firewall/CDN/API Gateway) -> Load Balancer -> Queue -> Compute -> Cache -> (Search Engine/Read Replica/SQL DB/NoSQL DB/Storage)
- **Delete Tool:** Remove services to recover 50% of the cost.
- **Time Controls:** Pause, Play (1x), and Fast Forward (3x).

#### On a phone or tablet

- **Tap:** Works like a left click. It places the selected service, links two nodes, or demolishes and unlinks with those tools.
- **One finger on a service:** Drag it to a new tile while the Select tool is active.
- **Two fingers:** Drag to pan, pinch to zoom.
- **HUD tabs:** On a phone-sized screen, in portrait or landscape, the panels open one at a time from the row of icons under the time controls. Tap the open one again to clear the board. The last icon resets the camera, standing in for `R`.
- Rotating the view (`Q`/`E`) and the top-down toggle (`T`) are keyboard-only for now.

## Strategy Tips

1.  **Block Attacks First:** Always place a Firewall immediately connected to the Internet. Malicious leaks destroy reputation fast (-5 per leak) and cost $50 per breach.
2.  **Use CDN for Static Content:** Connect Internet -> CDN -> Storage. The CDN handles 95% of static traffic cheaply!
3.  **Watch Service Health:** Damaged services have reduced capacity. Click to repair or enable Auto-Repair.
4.  **Scale for Traffic Surges:** RPS multiplies at milestones - prepare before ×2.0 at 3 minutes!
5.  **Balance Income vs Upkeep:** Start lean, scale as income grows. Over-provisioning leads to bankruptcy.
6.  **Use Cache Wisely:** Reduces database load significantly for READ requests.
7.  **Buffer with Queue:** Queue helps survive traffic burst events without dropping requests — and a queue-fed Compute fleet auto-scales on queue depth.
8.  **React to Events:** Watch the event bar - cost spikes mean hold off on purchases, traffic bursts mean ensure capacity.
9.  **API Gateway for Graceful Degradation:** Throttled requests only lose -0.2 reputation (vs -1.0 for failures). Great for surviving traffic spikes!
10. **Split DB Traffic with NoSQL:** Route READ/WRITE to NoSQL (faster, cheaper) and keep the Relational DB for SEARCH queries only.
11. **Search Engine for SEARCH Storms:** SEARCH is the heaviest traffic type (2.5x weight). A dedicated Search Engine processes it 3x faster than SQL DB.
12. **Read Replica for READ offloading:** Under "API Heavy" or "Read Heavy" shifts, a Read Replica prevents your main DB from drowning in READ requests.
13. **Serverless Function = pay-per-use:** Great for spiky traffic, but monitor finances — per-request cost ($0.03) adds up fast at high RPS.
14. **Place Monitoring early:** The metrics dashboard shows error rates and latency before the failure badges start raining.
15. **Read the failure badges:** Every dropped request tells you why it died — the badge is the lesson.

## Tech Stack

- **Core:** Vanilla JavaScript (native ES modules — an explicit module graph under `src/`, no bundler)
- **Rendering:** [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D visualization.
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the glassmorphism UI.
- **Build:** No build step required! The game is served raw from this repo by GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

**To play, click [PLAY NOW](https://pshenok.github.io/server-survival/).** No
install, no build, no account.

To run your own copy — a fork, or a change you just made — serve the folder
instead of opening the file. The game is native ES modules, and browsers fetch
module scripts in CORS mode, so a `file://` origin is blocked and
double-clicking `index.html` gets you the UI shell over an empty canvas. Any
static server works, and one is already on your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival.git
cd server-survival
python3 -m http.server 8000    # then open http://localhost:8000
```

## For Contributors

There is still **zero build step** — the dev tooling is optional and for contributors only:

- Run `npm install` once, then use `npm run check` to run ESLint and the full Vitest suite.
- CI runs the same check on every PR.
- The code is native ESM: `game.js` plus focused modules under `src/` (`sim/`, `core/`, `ui/`, `campaign/`, `persistence/`, `input/`).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the workflow.
