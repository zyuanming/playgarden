// Circuit breaker (#196, Wave 1 of #193) — the resilience flagship. An
// upstream stops sending traffic to a downstream that is failing, so requests
// fail FAST (or reroute to a healthy peer) instead of piling onto a dying
// node:
//
//   closed     normal. Every job outcome on the service is recorded in a small
//              rolling window; error rate > tripErrorRate over at least
//              tripMinEvents events -> open.
//   open       routing skips the service exactly like isDisabled does. After
//              openSec of game time -> half-open.
//   half-open  a limited number of probes (probeCount) is let through. Every
//              probe outcome is recorded: one failure sends it straight back
//              to open (timer reset), probeCount successes close it.
//
// State lives ON the service (initBreaker seeds it for every type, so the
// isRoutable() predicate never has to null-check):
//   breakerState     'closed' | 'open' | 'half-open'
//   breakerOpenedAt  STATE.elapsedGameTime of the last trip (display only)
//   breakerOpenSince seconds of game time accumulated in 'open'
//   breakerProbes    probes still allowed in 'half-open'
//   breakerEvents    rolling window of 0 (ok) / 1 (error), newest last
//
// COUNTERS: the breaker keeps its OWN window instead of reading the ring
// buffers in core/metrics.js. Deliberate — resilience must not depend on
// observability: the breaker has to work whether or not the player bought a
// Monitoring service, and metrics' 0.5 s sampling is the wrong granularity
// for an event-count threshold. The two counters are fed from the same call
// sites and agree; they are simply not the same mechanism.
//
// Timers accumulate the game-scaled dt Service.update() receives (same
// semantics as metrics.js / autoscaling.js), so pause freezes the breaker and
// fast-forward runs it faster — no wall clock anywhere.
