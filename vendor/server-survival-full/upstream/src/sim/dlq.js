// Dead-Letter Queue mechanic (#197, Sandbox archetypes batch 1). The DLQ is
// the only node that HOLDS already-failed requests instead of dropping them,
// turning a hard failure into a recoverable cost. It sits outside the normal
// job-dispatch pipeline entirely: nothing is ever routed INTO a DLQ's queue —
// a failing upstream parks its dead request directly via parkInDLQ(), and the
// DLQ drains itself from the update loop via tickDLQ(). So there is no handler
// registry entry for "dlq"; the wiring lives here + two call sites (the fail
// path in core/actions.js and the per-frame tick in Service.update()).
//
// Termination invariant (#191/#192): every parked request terminates. A parked
// request is inert (not moving, not queued, not a job) until the auto-drain
// removeRequest()s it — recovered, counted as neither success nor failure. If
// the DLQ is full, parkInDLQ() refuses and the caller fails the request
// normally, so nothing is ever stranded.

// function declaration, only dereferenced when a drain actually fires — long
// after both modules finish evaluating. Same established pattern as retry.js.
