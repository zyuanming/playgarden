// Educational failure badges (#156). When a request dies, a short floating
// label rises over the node that dropped it — "No route", "Read-only replica",
// "Queue full ×7" — and fades over ~1.5 s. Every failure becomes a teaching
// moment instead of a red flash the player cannot read.
//
// WIRING: core/actions.js calls spawnFailureBadge() from failRequest and
// throttleRequest with the reason its caller passed (see core/failure-reasons.
// js), and game.js ticks tickFailureBadges(dt) once per animate() frame
// alongside metricsTick — same game-scaled dt, so a badge freezes with the
// board at timeScale 0 and the player can read the failure moment on a paused
// or game-over screen (#189 / #194).
//
// AGGREGATION is what makes this usable rather than noise. At 2 RPS every
// failure deserves its own label; at 40 RPS a cascading failure would spray
// hundreds of unreadable sprites and tank the frame rate. So badges are keyed
// by (service, reason): a repeat hit while the badge is still alive COUNTS UP
// and refreshes its lifetime instead of spawning a second sprite. The active
// set is capped at MAX_BADGES; over the cap the oldest is dropped (Map keeps
// insertion order, so "oldest" is just the first key).
//
// THREE HYGIENE: each badge owns a canvas texture + sprite material, and both
// are disposed on expiry, on clearFailureBadges() (called from resetGame and
// clearAllServices) and when the cap evicts one. Sprites have no geometry of
// their own — THREE shares one internally — so the texture and the material
// are the whole disposal surface. Nothing else here allocates GPU memory.
//
// The badges live in their own scene group (game.js: badgeGroup) rather than
// as children of the service meshes: a badge must outlive the node that
// dropped the request, and sprite scale must not inherit a node's scale.
